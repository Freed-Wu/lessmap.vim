lessmap.vim
===========

Scan nomodifiable file more easily.

- `set nomodifiable` when you are not the author of the files according to
git.
- for those nomodifiable buffers (e.g. quickfix, help, startify, defx,
   undotree), use `u, d, U, D` to map `<C-u>, <C-d>, <C-b>, <C-f>`, like
   [less] or [philc/vimium].
- for those modifiable buffers, unmap these maps.

*Do you agree that not need to press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> is more confortable,
don't you?*
